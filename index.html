												<p>LEAN Executive Consulting Services</p>
										  <span>LEAN Exec delivers far beyond traditional consulting services, we provide business evolution. Similar to services provided to our start-up organizations through 'Envisionee', the LEAN team guides existing external business and leadership teams through total Lean transformation.

                                              <p>Envisionee</p>
                                          <span>Envisionee is where Envisioneers are born.  At Envisionee we offer aspiring entrepreneurs a systematic approach to launch small business. Each potential CEO of new enterprise is guided through the business practices and fundamentals they lack. The relationship does not end at any specific point, as ongoing mentorship services increase the client's connection with the organization. Rather than setting a specific endpoint to each engagement, the network effect of helping the micro entrepreneurs teach each other, share resources and contacts, and negotiate with vendors collectively is something unachievable with other entrepreneur training and mentoring services.  Envisionee is more than a Business Accelerator, we are helping convert the creativity and passion of prospective micro-entrepreneurs into sustainable businesses. With business training, mentoring, networking and access to ongoing support, Envisionee graduates have a greater chance of succeeding with their own start-up. Envisionee lowers the barriers of entry for entrepreneurs who might lack financing, direction or resources offered by the RBM Resource Company. . </span></li>

                                          <span>Every working relationship between advertisers or marketers and their clients should most importantly be based upon mutual benefit, respect and trust.  A Clientage is by definition a reference to clients or customers collectively. It also sums up in one word our principal of teamwork and partnership . Our strength is found within our deep involvement with each client independently and then collectively guiding the strategy and creative development of every project. We take the time to learn about proposed projects and the related businesses and objectives to understand our target before we develop and execute ideas. In keeping to the RBM Company's commitment to efficiency, technology, leadership and quality of work Clientage Interactive leverages in-house RBM assets to streamline a multi-platform production process under one roof. We produce the interactive &quot;box&quot; the other guy is thinking outside of! Our clients pay for creativity- not only media. If your agency's compensation is based on outdated models of percentages of your media budget, the only advise you likely get is an increased media spend. </span>										  </li>
